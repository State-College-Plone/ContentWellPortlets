4.0 (2011-08-18)
----------------

* Portlet managers' css identifiers are now of the format
  'AbovePortletManager1' instead of the previously used
  'portletsAboveContentA'
  [esteele]
  
* Use Plone 4's deco.gs to handle layout automatically. Portlet managers will
  now display as 1/[number of portlet managers with visible portlets] wide.
  For example, if three of the six portlet managers have visible portlets,
  each will fill 1/3 of the available area. Themes based on
  plonetheme.sunburst will see the changes. Others will either need to use
  sunburst's columns.css or manually align content using each portlet
  manager's unique id.
  [esteele]
  
* Depend on 'Products.CMFPlone' instead of 'Plone'. See
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10877 for more information.

  [esteele]
  
3.0b2 (2011-02-28)
------------------

* Change the way the footer portlets viewlet is registered so that it plays a
  bit more nicely with themes.
  [esteele]

* Add a class="row" to the footer portlet template to prevent it from bleeding
  into the content area.
  [esteele]
  
3.0b1 (2011-01-27)
------------------

* Pin to Plone 4.0 or better. Those looking for 3.x compatibility are best
  sticking with ContentWellPortlets 2.0.
